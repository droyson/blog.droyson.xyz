<p>A static website with no interaction is no fun. The only thing clickable in here right now is the few links for
  references and <a href="/about">About me</a> page. Apart from user interactions with the site just for fun there
  is one more important feedback that needs to be solved. On my last post 100% of the feedback was on not being able to
  quickly view all the post and having to scroll endlessly to reach to the next post. In this post we will solve this
  particular problem using Javascript <em>(JS)</em>.</p>
<p>Javascript is a programming language used in the browser. In past few years javascript has evolved from being used
  only within browsers to servers and other IoT devices. That's all the history I would be able to provide on JS for
  this post.</p>
<p>Moving ahead with the post. Javascript can be used to change the styles of an element, listen to clicks, fetch data
  from backend servers and a lot more. In here we will limit our usage to a few basic methods of manipulating the HTML
  elements. So let's get to it.</p>
<p>The content when loaded should be in a collapsed state for the user to be able to view more posts rather than having
  to scroll indefinitely to reach the next post. This is some simple CSS. Adding a static <code>height</code> to the
  card with <code>overflow: hidden</code> and now all 4 posts are visible with no scroll on the mobile screen. But how
  would the user read the post now? Well let's solve for this now.</p>
<p>Let's add an <em>expand</em> link to the bottom of every post and position it absolutely to the bottom of every card.
  For details on how to position elements check out my previous post <a href="/posts/3">CSS Positions</a>.</p>
<p>After all this CSS trickery the page looks like the image below.</p>

<p>Now that we have a link to Expand the card let's make it functional.</p>
<p>First step would be to create a js file and include it with the html using the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<p>In the js file add an event listener for <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> so that the JS code is loaded only after the
  HTML is loaded. This acts as a safety and helps encapsulate the JS code within a function instead of <a
    href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-global-namespace-pollution-in-javascript" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener">polluting the global namespace</a>.</p>
<p>Get references to all the <em>Expand/Collapse</em> links using <code>querySelectorAll</code> and add click listeners
  to each link.</p>
<p>When the link gets clicked the event listener callback is triggered in which <code>this</code> is a keyword
  referencing the element that got clicked. Find the parent article to find out if the card is in collapsed or expanded
  state and update the class of the article accordingly. We also update the text in the link to display the correct
  action the link will perform i.e. <em>Expand</em> or <em>Collapse</em>.</p>
<p>Below is the code that I used to implement the expand/collapse functionality.</p>

<p>And that's how you achieve interactivity in a web page.</p>
