<p>In the <a href="/posts/1">previous post</a> we discussed about hosting a static page on github with a custom
  domain. Now let's get started with one of the most important part of a website - Design. I call it the
  important part of a website cause - <i>Jo dikhta hai, wahi bikta hai</i> ( <a
    href="https://translate.google.com/?um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&client=tw-ob#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=en&text=%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%88%20%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%88"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loosely translated by google as</a> - <i>What you see sells</i> ).
</p>
<p>To have some clarity on the page structure I decided to move <a href="/about">About me</a> to a separate
  page.</p>
<p>The next step for me was creating a logo and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener">favicon</a> for the site. There are multiple file formats to create a logo but SVG is my go
  to choice for the simple reason that it is a vector graphic is not prone to pixelation. Favicon in the
  required format can be generated from SVG file using one of the many online converters.</p>
<p>It was a tedious task as I spent an entire day on designing the logo. I used <a href="https://inkscape.org/"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">inkscape</a> to create the SVGs. It's free and easy to use once you get over
  the learning curve ( Which was 4+ hours for me ðŸ˜› ). The <a href="https://inkscape.org/learn/tutorials/"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">official tutorials</a> provided by inkscape are easy to understand and get
  started with.</p>
<p>The first rule of webpage design is - Mobile first. Why? Cause,</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/mobile-desktop-internet-usage-statistics" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">mobile usage is higher compared to desktop</a> and</li>
  <li>scaling up from mobile layout to desktop is easier than scaling down.</li>
</ol>
<p>To achieve this switch to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile device with Device Mode</a>.</p>

  <em><u>Note:</u> To move on with the rest of the section make sure you understand some <a

</p>
<p>Before coding it is better to have a visual in hand. I did a quick pen and paper sketch before implementing
  it. Below is a rough sketch of what I had in mind.</p>
<img src="/blog/post-2/page_pen_sketch-small.jpg" alt="Pen paper sketch for the page" loading="lazy"
  srcset="/blog/post-2/page_pen_sketch-small.jpg 300w, /blog/post-2/page_pen_sketch.jpg 1080w"
  sizes="(max-width: 800px) 300px, 1080px">
<p>As per this sketch, I needed the header to be fixed on top. The intuitive approach is to use
  <code>position: fixed</code> but then you would be trying to fix the margin since the content is now
  overlapping. The simpler way to go about is to use <code>position: sticky</code> and bam! it works like magic.
</p>
<p>Each post needed to have a card like feel to it. To do that add a <code>max-width</code> on the container for
  each posts and some <code>box-shadow</code> to visually raise the content from the rest of the page. Center
  align the cards for larger screens using <code>margin: auto</code> style.</p>
<p>Few pointers on creating a responsive page.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Normalize.css</a> to
    render consistent looking elements.</li>
  <li>Set <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> on all elements using wildcard (<code>*</code>)</li>
  <li>Set the document level <code>font-size</code> in pixels (<code>px</code>) and then use <code>rem</code>
    for setting the font-size of the elements. The following blog - <a
      href="https://www.element84.com/blog/responsive-typography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Responsive
      Typography: rem, em, and px</a> - describes this use case beautifully.</li>
  <li>Always have a <code>max-width</code> for the main content. This ensures that while viewing on screens with
    higher resolution a user doesn't have to move his head across the length of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a simple.css to get you started:</p>
