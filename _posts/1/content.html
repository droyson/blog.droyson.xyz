<p>I'll be using this blog as an example for this post. The idea here is to evolve the blog with every new post
  in this series. So please don't judge me on how the blog appears, it might very will be a work in progress.
</p>
<p>For this blog I wanted to host it on my personal domain so step 1 would be purchasing a domain name. This can
  be skipped if you do not want a custom domain name. I got mine from <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener">GoDaddy.com</a> but you may use one of the many DNS providers available.
  Purchasing a domain is as simple as creating an account and making the payment and voila you have your domain
  name ready to be used.</p>
<p>Second step is to create a repository on <a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a>.
  In here create a file named index.html and type in the html. Having trouble
  writing html? Copy the below example.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/droyson/48cb812b718ddcb3d78ad9f17f705616.js"></script>
<p>I'm assuming basic knowledge of <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener">git commands</a> here.</p>
<p>Once you have committed and pushed the changes to your remote github repository go to "Settings" tab in
  github and scroll down to Github Pages section. Update the branch and directory dropdowns as shown in the
  screenshot below and hit save. </p>

<p>A few seconds of github magic and boom! you have a live webpage. The link to your page will be available in
  the "Github Pages" section.</p>
<p>Next step would be pointing the domain to this new page. Now that you have the page live you should be able
  to see the "Custom domain" section. Add the domain or subdomain that you need to point to your webpage and
  click save. Now go to Manage DNS settings page provided by your DNS provider (GoDaddy.com in my case). This
  screen may vary based on DNS providers but more or less will have the same structure as shown below</p>

<p>That's all folks! Now you should have the page live on the custom domain.</p>
