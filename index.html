      <h3>Creating a website, Part 2: Design</h3>
      <section>
        <p>In the <a href="#post-1">previous post</a> we discussed about hosting a static page on github with a custom domain. Now let's get started with one of the most important part of a website - Design. I call it the important part of a website cause - <i>Jo dikhta hai, wahi bikta hai</i> ( <a href="https://translate.google.com/?um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&client=tw-ob#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=en&text=%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%8B%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%88%20%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%88" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loosely translated by google as</a> - <i>What you see sells</i> ).</p>
        <p>To have some clarity on the page structure I decided to move <a href="/about.html">About me</a> to a separate page.</p>
        <p>The next step for me was creating a logo and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favicon</a> for the site. There are multiple file formats to create a logo but SVG is my go to choice for the simple reason that it is a vector graphic is not prone to pixelation. Favicon in the required format can be generated from SVG file using one of the many online converters.</p>
        <p>It was a tedious task as I spent an entire day on designing the logo. I used <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inkscape</a> to create the SVGs. It's free and easy to use once you get over the learning curve ( Which was 4+ hours for me ðŸ˜› ). The <a href="https://inkscape.org/learn/tutorials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official tutorials</a> provided by inkscape are easy to understand and get started with.</p>
        <p>The first rule of webpage design is - Mobile first. Why? Cause,</p>
          <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/mobile-desktop-internet-usage-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile usage is higher compared to desktop</a> and</li>
            <li>scaling up from mobile layout to desktop is easier than scaling down.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To achieve this switch to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile device with Device Mode</a>.</p>
        <p>
          <em><u>Note:</u> To move on with the rest of the section make sure you understand some <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic CSS</a>.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Before coding it is better to have a visual in hand. I did a quick pen and paper sketch before implementing it. Below is a rough sketch of what I had in mind.</p>
        <img src="/images/blog/post-2/page_pen_sketch.jpg" alt="Pen paper sketch for the page" loading="lazy">
        <p>As per this sketch, I needed the header to be fixed on top. The intuitive approach is to use <code>position: fixed</code> but then you would be trying to fix the margin since the content is now overlapping. The simpler way to go about is to use <code>position: sticky</code> and bam! it works like magic.</p>
        <p>Each post needed to have a card like feel to it. To do that add a <code>max-width</code> on the container for each posts and some <code>box-shadow</code> to visually raise the content from the rest of the page. Center align the cards for larger screens using <code>margin: auto</code> style.</p>
        <p>Few pointers on creating a responsive page.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Normalize.css</a> to render consistent looking elements.</li>
          <li>Set <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> on all elements using wildcard (<code>*</code>)</li>
          <li>Set the document level <code>font-size</code> in pixels (<code>px</code>) and then use <code>rem</code> for setting the font-size of the elements. The following blog - <a href="https://www.element84.com/blog/responsive-typography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Responsive Typography: rem, em, and px</a> - describes this use case beautifully.</li>
          <li>Always have a <code>max-width</code> for the main content. This ensures that while viewing on screens with higher resolution a user doesn't have to move his head across the length of the screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here's a simple.css to get you started:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/droyson/228d9a75dec614ecacadfd6f2b97308a.js"></script>
        <p>Like the way this blog page looks now? Feel free to get the code from <a href="https://github.com/droyson/blog.droyson.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my github repo.</a></p>
        <p>Would love to hear the feedback for the page. Drop me a mail at <a href="mailto:me.droyson@gmail.com">me.droyson@gmail.com</a></p>
        <p>That's all for now. Ciao until we meet again!</p>

      <h3>Creating a website, Part 1: Hosting</h3>
      <section>
        <p>I'll be using this blog as an example for this post. The idea here is to evolve the blog with every new post in this series. So please don't judge me on how the blog appears, it might very will be a work in progress.</p>
        <p>For this blog I wanted to host it on my personal domain so step 1 would be purchasing a domain name. This can be skipped if you do not want a custom domain name. I got mine from <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoDaddy.com</a> but you may use one of the many DNS providers available. Purchasing a domain is as simple as creating an account and making the payment and voila you have your domain name ready to be used.</p>
        <p>Second step is to create a repository on <a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a>. In here create a file named index.html and type in the html. Having trouble writing html? Copy the below example.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/droyson/48cb812b718ddcb3d78ad9f17f705616.js"></script>
        <p>I'm assuming basic knowledge of <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git commands</a> here.</p>
        <p>Once you have committed and pushed the changes to your remote github repository go to "Settings" tab in github and scroll down to Github Pages section. Update the branch and directory dropdowns as shown in the screenshot below and hit save. </p>
        <img src="/images/blog/post-1/gh_pages_setup.png" alt="Github Pages Setup" loading="lazy">
        <p>A few seconds of github magic and boom! you have a live webpage. The link to your page will be available in the "Github Pages" section.</p>
        <p>Next step would be pointing the domain to this new page. Now that you have the page live you should be able to see the "Custom domain" section. Add the domain or subdomain that you need to point to your webpage and click save. Now go to Manage DNS settings page provided by your DNS provider (GoDaddy.com in my case). This screen may vary based on DNS providers but more or less will have the same structure as shown below</p>
        <img src="/images/blog/post-1/godaddy-subdomain-register.png" alt="GoDaddy domain register" loading="lazy">
        <p>Curious as to how I got to these steps? Read more here - <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.</a></p>
        <p>That's all folks! Now you should have the page live on the custom domain.</p>
