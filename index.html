      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>Hey there, this is Royson. Let me do a quick intro of myself. I'm a software developer by profession and an amalgamation of good and bad decisions in the process ;). </p>
      <!-- For now that should be sufficient info to begin with. Let's head over to the blog. -->
      <section>
        <h4>Why am I writing this?</h4>
        <p>Well there are 2 main reasons to this.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It's been a little over 6 years that I've been working as a software developer, more precisely a frontend engineer. In all this while I've not had my own website or a tech blog. It's not that common for every frontend dev to have a blog of their own but when you have the skill set why not show it off a bit, right?</li>
          <li>It turns out that human brain has a limited memory and remembering stuff is a difficult job. So this blog will be a journal to everything that I think is important to remember. Hopefully me documenting stuff might come in handy for someone someday</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now that I've spoken on why I'm writing this let's move to the <a href="#post-1">first post.</a></p>

      <h3>Creating a website, Part 1: Hosting</h3>
      <section>
        <p>I'll be using this blog as an example for this post. The idea here is to evolve the blog with every new post in this series. So please don't judge me on how the blog appears, it might very will be a work in progress.</p>
        <p>For this blog I wanted to host it on my personal domain so step 1 would be purchasing a domain name. This can be skipped if you do not want a custom domain name. I got mine from <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoDaddy.com</a> but you may use one of the many DNS providers available. Purchasing a domain is as simple as creating an account and making the payment and voila you have your domain name ready to be used.</p>
        <p>Second step is to create a repository on <a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a>. In here create a file named index.html and type in the html. Having trouble writing html? Copy the below example.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/droyson/48cb812b718ddcb3d78ad9f17f705616.js"></script>
        <p>I'm assuming basic knowledge of <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git commands</a> here.</p>
        <p>Once you have committed and pushed the changes to your remote github repository go to "Settings" tab in github and scroll down to Github Pages section. Update the branch and directory dropdowns as shown in the screenshot below and hit save. </p>
        <img src="/images/blog/post-1/gh_pages_setup.png" alt="Github Pages Setup" loading="lazy">
        <p>A few seconds of github magic and boom! you have a live webpage. The link to your page will be available in the "Github Pages" section.</p>
        <p>Next step would be pointing the domain to this new page. Now that you have the page live you should be able to see the "Custom domain" section. Add the domain or subdomain that you need to point to your webpage and click save. Now go to Manage DNS settings page provided by your DNS provider (GoDaddy.com in my case). This screen may vary based on DNS providers but more or less will have the same structure as shown below</p>

        <p>Curious as to how I got to these steps?

        <p>That's all folks! Now you should have the page live on the custom domain.</p>
