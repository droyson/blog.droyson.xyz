      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>Hey there, this is Royson. Let me do a quick intro of myself. I'm a software developer by profession and an amalgamation of good and bad decisions in the process ;). </p>
      <section>
        <h4>Why am I writing this?</h4>
        <p>Well there are 2 main reasons to this.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It's been a little over 6 years that I've been working as a software developer, more precisely a frontend engineer. In all this while I've not had my own website or a tech blog. It's not that common for every frontend dev to have a blog of their own but when you have the skill why not show it off a bit, right?</li>
          <li>It turns out that human brain has a limited memory and remembering stuff is a difficult job. So this blog will be a journal to everything that I think is important to remember. Hopefully me documenting stuff might come in handy for someone someday</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now that I've spoken on why I'm writing this let's move to the <a href="/">blog</a></p>
